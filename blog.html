        <h2 class="subtitle" >   Why Does Farming Matter?</h2>
        <p class="intro-text art-text" >Farmers and crofters are on the frontline of climate change,
           and they also hold the solution as managers of the land.
           Farming covers three-quarters of Scotland's land, 
          but current methods have a big impact on nature and the climate.</p>
        <p class="intro-text art-text" >   To reach climate targets, restore nature, 
          and make sure we can keep farming strong in the future,
          the Scottish Government must change how it supports farmers.</p>
        <p class="intro-text art-text" >   Supporting nature-friendly farming will 
          help farmers and crofters produce food while protecting nature, fighting climate change,
           and strengthening rural communities. That's why we're calling
           for fairer funding that works for climate, nature, and people.</p>

        <p class="intro-text art-text" >We believe Scottish Farm House organic milk is the most pure, most natural 
          and most delicious milk in the supermarket. Full of goodness and with no nasties, our organic milk is milk as nature intended - produced by happy cows
           who live most of their lives out of doors grazing Scotland's lush green clover-rich pastures.</p>
        <p class="intro-text art-text" >From grass to glass organic makes a difference. It means that our farmers are working with nature, giving their cows the freedom to graze and a healthy, natural diet. The result? 
          Happy cows and naturally delicious milk, pure and full of natural goodness for your family to enjoy.</p>
        <p class="intro-text art-text" >Whole, semi-skimmed and skimmed Scottish organic milk is available in supermarkets 
          across Scotland under own label brands.  Look for Farm House organic on the label or
           the Saltire flag displayed on organic milk to be sure you're buying fresh Scottish organic milk.</p>
